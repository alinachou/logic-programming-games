# Logic Programming Games
These interactive games are programmed using logic programming to define the rulesets and are displayed through html pages.
## Four in a Row
Four in a Row is similar to the game Tic Tac Toe and Gomoku. Two players take turns placing pieces and the first player that connects four pieces in a row wins. With logic programming, the board and positions as well as the winning states and rulesets are easily defined.
## Reversi-Othello
This game leverages logic programming to recreate the Othello game and produce variations. First, the project recreates the current Othello game. There are three main issues with the current game: inflexible board size, game mode, and design. The project then proposes solutions to address the problems through logic programming and writes a Python script to generate HTML worksheets.
